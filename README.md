# ros-nice-api

Socket.IO, WebRTC & other API packages

This is implemented using:

- [`python-socketio`](https://python-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
- [`aiortc`](https://aiortc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Initial code was self-plagiarized from <https://github.com/Interpause/nicepipe/commit/fd693a6638f8f08549b6a13a93d71b6bea4d6810> by [@Interpause](https://github.com/Interpause).

It might be reimplemented in the future using <https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rclnodejs> to utilize the NodeJS ecosystem, the native ecosystem of many APIs.
